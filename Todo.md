Decide on:

-   Data to display in the user breakdown on the home page

Frontend:

-   Search bar for the squirrel stories... somewhere
-   iframe links for each card div
    -   Since each card has a unique id, they could all be located at sqrrlz.com/cards/{id} or smth like that
    -   iframe takes a url, so the iframe item could be <iframe src='sqrrlz.com/cards/{id}' />
-   Adaptable CSS for different screen sizes

Server:

-   User accounts
-   Connect up/down voting to each individual card
-   Move squirrel census stories to database
-   Sort squirrel stories by topic
-   Ability to search through the stories by topics and/or story content
-   Auto Capitalize each topic in the cards

Presentation:

-   Take final result from poll and fill them out on the slides
-   Write about what the results say on the slides
-   Take pictures of final home page and put it on the final slides
-   Write about prototype proposal and how our product solves our problem
