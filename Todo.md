**Performance**

-   Skeleton preloader
    -   https://css-tricks.com/building-skeleton-screens-css-custom-properties/
-   Intersectionobservers on the cards
    -   We could conditionally load cards instead of paging them
        -   Check if there's a next log returned by the API, if not, go to the next page for content (or something to the same effect)
-   Preloading for components
-   Examples of efficient websites
    -   Github: https://github.blog/2021-01-29-making-githubs-new-homepage-fast-and-performant/

## **Frontend**

-   style Profile pic stuff
-   searching twice doesnt work
-   individual cards is broken
-   Splash page to welcome people
-   Change gallery to archive

## **Server:**

-   Make pfp part of user model
-   New posts going to the bottom (maybe server?)

## **Other**

-   buy Sqqrlz.com
-   Replying
-   Communities

## **Watch Out For:**

-   Load Posts isn't happening every time the match is changed
-   we used window.location.href instead of history.push()
