**Performance**

-   Skeleton preloader
    -   https://css-tricks.com/building-skeleton-screens-css-custom-properties/
-   Intersectionobservers on the cards
    -   We could conditionally load cards instead of paging them
        -   Check if there's a next log returned by the API, if not, go to the next page for content (or something to the same effect)
-   Preloading for components
-   Examples of efficient websites

## **Frontend**

-   Use RegEx to make links clickable in messages
-   If Hashtags are too long they just overflow
-   ^ Same for text

-   post doesnt appear on home page after creation

## **Server:**

-   searching by hashtags doesnt search entire database
-   Maybe a notification center

## **Other**

-   PERFORMANCE
-   buy Sqqrlz.com
-   Communities

## **Watch Out For:**

-   Load Posts isn't happening every time the match is changed
-   we used window.location.href instead of history.push()
