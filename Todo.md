**Performance**

-   Skeleton preloader
    -   https://css-tricks.com/building-skeleton-screens-css-custom-properties/
-   Intersectionobservers on the cards
    -   We could conditionally load cards instead of paging them
        -   Check if there's a next log returned by the API, if not, go to the next page for content (or something to the same effect)
-   Preloading for components
-   Examples of efficient websites

## **Frontend**

-   Splash page to welcome people
-   hashtags overflow aaaaah
-   infinite scolling showing results that don't match search query in archive
-   button in about page to see landing page
-   css for pfps on posts
-   pfp and username on post link to user's posts

## **Server:**

-   New posts going to the bottom (maybe server?)
-   searching by content doesnt work

## **Other**

-   buy Sqqrlz.com
-   Replying
-   Communities

## **Watch Out For:**

-   Load Posts isn't happening every time the match is changed
-   we used window.location.href instead of history.push()
