## **Frontend:**

    -   Delete posts you created
    -   Admins can delete any posts
-   Move squirrel census stories to database
-   Ability to search through the stories by topics and/or story content

## **Presentation:**

-   Take final result from poll and fill them out on the slides
-   Write about what the (very unfiltered and totally accurate) results say on the slides
-   Site demonstration?
-   Squirrel jokes (https://upjoke.com/squirrel-jokes)
    -   I got kicked out of the park today for arranging the squirrels by height
        They didnâ€™t like my critter sizing
