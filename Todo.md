**Performance**

-   Skeleton preloader
    -   https://css-tricks.com/building-skeleton-screens-css-custom-properties/
-   Intersectionobservers on the cards
    -   We could conditionally load cards instead of paging them
        -   Check if there's a next log returned by the API, if not, go to the next page for content (or something to the same effect)
-   Preloading for components
-   Examples of efficient websites

## **Frontend**

-   on screen too small cards overflow in the gallery
-   Little hover desc for icons
-   Favicon on live site
-   Infinite scrolling for the home page, too
    -   when the screen gets smaller user section goes to the top

## **Server:**

-   Liked post thing?
-   Fix how the styling on liked posts works, basically we need to make the user load them, instead of individual cards

## **Other**

-   buy Sqqrlz.com
-   Profile pics :sunglasses:
-   contact page
