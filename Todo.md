## **Frontend:**

-   Flickering user icon "feature"
-   fix hashtag not getting them
-   Remove "home" section of menu and put link in header "sqrrlz"

    - Give them the linking and stuff

## **Server:**

    -   Default val

## **If We Have Time**

-   style finished hashtag in create form
-   buy Sqqrlz.com
    - *Change django token in settings if we make the site live (major security flaw oopsies)*
-   styleize editing
-   Sort by topics with the links given by the server
-   admins (view edit&delete post buttons, those functionalities)
-   limit hompage post num
-   gallery embeds and upvoting
-   Add intersectionobservers to cards (performance) (Just scroll down, not pages)

## **Presentation:**

-   Site demonstration?
-   Squirrel jokes (https://upjoke.com/squirrel-jokes)
    -   I got kicked out of the park today for arranging the squirrels by height—they didn’t like my critter sizing
