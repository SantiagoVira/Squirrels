                    You may be wondering.... why? Wha... wh.. why though? Don't
                    worry, we got you. This is the story of our Squirrel-cial
                    media site.

                    In early February 2021, 4 young programmers were tasked with
                    creating a project to solve a health problem. As they were
                    looking through the provided datasets, the stumbled across
                    the perfect idea. In 2018, the New York City Government
                    conducted a squirrel census in Central Park, recording
                    sightings of squirrels as well as their colors and attitudes
                    towards the census takers. As the group was laughing at how
                    absurd this was, the idea was formed. They realized they
                    could share the mental health boost provided by the
                    absurdity of a squirrel census with the rest of the world.
                    Just as they thought it couldn't get any better, well you
                    can probably guess. It got better. There was another dataset
                    about squirrels. But this one, this one was about the
                    stories. The events that took place during a sighting of a
                    squirrel. Neatly tagged and packed into categories, these
                    stories were often ridiculous, and some didn't even relate
                    to squirrels at all.
                    <br />
                    It was perfect.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And that is how <strong>Sqrrlz</strong> was formed. Taking
                    these silly squirrel stories and posting them, just to share
                    a litle bit of laughter in these times. You're Welcome.
